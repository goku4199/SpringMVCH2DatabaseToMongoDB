1.added compile('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-mongodb') in dependencies in gradle
we took out spring data-jpa and went to mongoDB

Embedded MongoDB Configuration

compile('de.flapdoodle.embed:de.flapdoodle.embed.mongo')
compile group: 'cz.jirutka.spring', name: 'embedmongo-spring', version: '1.3.1'

added this in build.gradle

spring.data.mongodb.port=0
spring.data.mongodb.host=localhost

added this to application.properties

Refactoring Data Model for MongoDB

applied @Document, @Id and @dbref in domain.
remove all bidirectional connections recipe = this.ingredient , ingredient = this.recipe which we did between Recipe and Ingredient etc

Also in mongoDB emmbeding of documents occur b/w documents in a collection
Also in MongoDB dbref is used to establish relationships between documents of different collections.

we found that @Document create a collection when Document(collection = '') is not specified in mongoDB so 3 collections are created which contain 1 document
so what dbref does is thatIn Spring Data MongoDB, DBRef (Database Reference) is a feature that allows you to create references between documents in different collections within a MongoDB database. It's a way to establish relationships between documents similar to how foreign keys work in relational databases. This feature enables you to model relationships between entities in a more flexible manner.

dbref basically establish relationship if putted on one entity the uni-directional relationship is created if putted on both entities the bi-directional relationship is created.

Resolving bugs

1.
bug in recipeForm.html
after updating recipe ingredients are not shown
mongo dosent do the merge quite the same way jpa does so when we were doing post mongo was giving empty list it wasnt doing merge

what is actually causing the bug is that the in jpa if we dont pass any ingredient then the ingredients which are added is taken in from the command object
but in mongo this does not work as we have to properly specify the binding with th:field to the command object

needed to convert the Ingredientcommand and category command from set to list in recipie command bcz spring mvc does not bind to set but it will bind to list

2. code review need to be done
error while clicking the view,update,delete button on ingredient page

created a uuid value in ingredient domain
as ingredient is now a list property spring and mongo will not give it id by @ID

to to resolve this error we
